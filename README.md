# WPA2-Password-Cracker


This repository contains a Bash script for catching WPA2 4-way handshake using Aircrack-ng tools. The script automates the process of capturing BSSID and Handshake for a specified Wi-Fi network.


# Disclaimer

This project is a demonstration and educational tool developed for learning and research purposes only. The primary goal is to provide insights into network security and cryptography by showcasing the vulnerabilities associated with weak handshake protocols.
